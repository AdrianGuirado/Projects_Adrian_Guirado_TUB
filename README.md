## BLE Library
A library developed in C aimed at implementing the AT Commands that the device uses, integrating them into the library to enable communication with an STM32 board. Itâ€™s not finished yet, so please keep that in mind.

## Bachelor's Thesis
Project focused on connecting a receiver and transmitter to collect RSSI and SNR data from a LoRa 2.4 GHz transmission.

## INMAN Exercises - Unit 2
Exercises from one part of the "Optimization and Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Network Management" course. Not all exercises have been uploaded by the teacher yet that is why there is none of AI exercises are included. I am currently taking this course and I will complete it before arriving to Berlin. The course focuses on programming algorithms and AI for network management, so I thought it might be useful to share it with you since the topic you have sent to me seems related. Although the problems are unsolved, they will need to be completed in order to pass the subject. 

## Software Architecture
This subject was taken last semester. It includes the documentation and code for an application similar to Excel but operated via the command line. The focus of the course was learning advanced concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.
